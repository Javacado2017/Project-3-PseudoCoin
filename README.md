# MVC ARCHITECTURE
- This follows the MVC architecture ... explain how
- Understand more on "middleware", client, & server defined code  
- Global MVC architecture process diagram 
- index.js vs server.js ... look at/ask why certain developers use one vs the other

# SWIMLANE TO EXPLAIN CODE: 
- Create a swimlane diagram to explain architecture

# WEBPACK: 
- Check about the HtmlWebpackPlugin 
- CSS/SASS loaders? 

# DEPENDENCIES: 
- Use npm install --save insert-package-name-here for local dependencies
- Use npm install --save-dev insert-package-name-here for dev dependencies

# ADD FUNCTIONALITY
- "we're updated out privacy policy" funny alert upon rendering
- See is anyone wants to help add another API (AJAX class_content, recent react homework)

# COMPARTMENTALIZING CODE???
- Blah ... blah ... blah ... soemthign asldjkflasdfjklaer

# WHAT I NEED TO WORK ON
- Mongo models for the dashboard capability

- Pages folder and then individual component folders 
- look into .ejs files for embeded javascript
